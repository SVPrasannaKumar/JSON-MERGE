# JSON-MERGE
1. Accept the following parameters as an input 
   a. Folder Path: The folder where all the JSON files are stored. 
   b. Input File Base Name: The common prefix all file names share. In our example above, this prefix was data. 
   c. Output File Base Name: The prefix for the merged file name generated by the merge utility.
d. Max File Size: The maximum file size (in bytes) that each merged file is allowed to be.  
2. The utility will read all files in the Folder Path that begin with the Input File Base Name, and process them in increasing order of the number added as a suffix to each file (1,2,3,....,12,13,...).
3. The utility will ensure that the output files are named using the Output File Base Name as a prefix, and a counter as a suffix.
4. Merged files will never be greater than Max File Size. 
5. Each output file will contain a proper JSON array.
